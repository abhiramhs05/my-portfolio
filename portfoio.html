            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Greetings! I am ABHIRAM HS, also known as TOMHAZE, hailing from the beautiful state of Kerala, India. Currently pursuing my passion at SRM University, I am on a journey to acquire knowledge and skills in the realm of technology.

               <h2>Academic Pursuits </h2> 
                I am enrolled in the BTech Computer Science Engineering program with a specialization in Cyber Security. My academic pursuits align with my keen interest in ensuring digital safety and fortifying the online world against potential threats.
                
                <h2>Diverse Skill Set</h2>
                Beyond the academic realm, I wear multiple hats. I am not just a student; I am a Front-end Developer crafting digital experiences, a Mobile Photographer capturing moments, a meticulous Video and Photo Editor refining visuals, a Creative Graphics Designer bringing ideas to life, and a skilled PowerPoint Presentation Maker weaving compelling narratives.
                
                <h2>Passion for Technology</h2>
                My enthusiasm for technology goes beyond the classroom. I am on a perpetual quest to stay abreast of the latest trends, seeking opportunities to contribute to the ever-evolving tech landscape.
                
                <h2>Let's Connect</h2>
                I believe in the power of collaboration and networking. Feel free to connect with me and explore the synergies between our interests and aspirations.
